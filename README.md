## Settings

![](Gifs/Menu.gif)

The menu is under the main menu `Edit`. Forgive me about the ugly icon!

On this page, you can edit your menus!

You can edit the `Name` of the menu and the keys for it. Just activate that cell for the keys, and press the key you want to use.

If you want to add a menu item to the radial menu, just find it!

`Copy` and `Paste` are designed for sharing! If you have a great shortcut preset, please don't forget to share!

The changes only be applied when you click `Apply`. `Cancel` to reset the preset to the state that you opened this window.

Have fun fasting your Grasshopper experience!
